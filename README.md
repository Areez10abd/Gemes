Classic Games Collection üéÆ
This repository contains a collection of three classic games developed in different programming paradigms and languages. Each game showcases unique programming concepts, ranging from fundamental programming to object-oriented design and low-level assembly language.

üìö Games Included:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tetris (C++ with PF Concepts)
A classic block-stacking game built using Programming Fundamentals.
Features smooth block movement, line-clearing mechanics, and score tracking.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Space Shooter (C++ with OOP)
A 2D arcade-style space battle game developed with Object-Oriented Programming principles.
Includes spaceship movement, enemy waves, shooting mechanics, and a dynamic scoring system.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pacman (Assembly Language)
The iconic maze game recreated in Assembly Language.
Features maze navigation, ghost AI, pellet collection, and score tracking.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Tetris: C++ (Programming Fundamentals)
Space Shooter: C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
Pacman: Assembly Language (x86 architecture)
